# Data Science Projects
This is a repo I created to showcase some data science projects a few years ago.  

At the Kaggle Competitions folder you can find some of my notebooks used in that site.  
[Titanic Competition](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle%20Competitions/Titanic) [Notebook](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competitions/Titanic/Titanic%20-%20PaulopcplNotebook.ipynb): last time I checked I was on the Top 8%. But nowadays these rankings are not worth much since anyone can find on the internet the code to get 100% score on these competitions.  
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Competition](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle%20Competitions/House%20Prices%20-%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques): last time I checked I was on the Top 12%. The same observation from above applies here.  
* [1 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering Notebook](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competitions/House%20Prices%20-%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques/House%20Prices%20Project%20-%20Part%201%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb)  
* [2 - Regression Techniques Notebook](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle%20Competitions/House%20Prices%20-%20Advanced%20Regression%20Techniques/House%20Prices%20Project%20-%20Part%202%20-%20Regression%20Techniques.ipynb)

I also show a simple application of the ARIMA Model by [forecasting the 1950's Brazilian GDP](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Forecasting%20the%201950's%20Brazilian%20GDP) [(notebook)](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Forecasting%20the%201950's%20Brazilian%20GDP/Forecasting%20the%201950's%20Brazilian%20GDP%20-%20The%20ARIMA%20Model.ipynb).

During my Master I worked with access to education in the Brazilian Municipalities. I present here some of the visualizations I published in an [article in 2017](https://www.scielo.br/pdf/es/v38n140/1678-4626-es-es0101-73302017166662.pdf) detailing the [access to daycares in the Brazilian Municipalities](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Access%20to%20Daycares%20in%20Brazil). Unfortunately the interactive map is not displayed online, but you can download all the files and display it locally. The GIF I present at the end of the [notebook](https://github.com/Paulopcpl/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Access%20to%20Daycares%20in%20Brazil/Access%20to%20Daycares%20in%20Brazil.ipynb) shows how much the landscape changed in 12 years and how much it needs to keep on changing until we have universal access to daycare services in most of the Municipalities in Brazil.
