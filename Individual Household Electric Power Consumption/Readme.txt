Here I briefly present an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Eletric Power Consumption Dataset (available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#).

The analysis is in the .ipynb file in this folder named Individual Household Electric Power Consumption.pynb.
In this file I present some visualizations and descriptive statistics analysing the series found in the aforementioned dataset.
